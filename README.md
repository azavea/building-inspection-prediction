## Predicting Building Code Compliance with Machine Learning

This project from [Azavea](https://www.azavea.com/) is a machine learning model for predicting building inspection outcomes. For a high-level understanding of the work, check out our [post about it on the Azavea blog](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2017/09/15/building-inspection-prediction/). We have also written up a more detailed description of our process [here](https://azavea.github.io/building-inspection-prediction/index.html).

This analysis was completed by the Data Analytics Team at Azavea. The data we used came from the City of Philadelphia Departments of Licenses and Inspections, Revenue, and Innovation and Technology. We conducted the analysis using R and made use of the following packages: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `data.table`, `magrittr`, `sp`, `rgdal`, `lubridate`, `plyr`, `forcats`, `caret`, `spatstat`, `RCurl`, `jsonlite`, `Boruta`, `pROC`, `statmod`, `h2o`, `sf`, `ggjoy`, `plotROC`, `ggpubr`, `waffle`, and `svglite`.
